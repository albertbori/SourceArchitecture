# SourceArchitecture

A simple yet powerful framework for reactive programming with only a minimal optimized set of types. Sources are self-contained, highly testable objects which manage and update some function-specific state. Sources can be chained, their values can be transformed and they can easily be composed together into more complex Sources.

Sources can automatically drive updates to both SwiftUI and UIKit views / view controllers using just one implementation.
